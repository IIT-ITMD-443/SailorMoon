# SailorMoon
An interactive anime-themed web application that showcases favorite series and characters through a multi-page interface. The site includes a home introduction page, an anime list with like buttons, and a Sailor Guardians character page with visual theming inspired by the Sailor Moon universe. Built with Vue 3 and Vite, and styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS, it demonstrates client-side routing, component-based architecture, theme management, and interactive UI behavior. The project emphasizes visual consistency, responsive layout structure, and clean navigation patterns while showcasing modern frontend framework fundamentals.
